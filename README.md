## Project Overview:
As this was our final project at Maker's Academy, we decided to pay tribute to its table-tennis culture by creating an application dedicated to the art. The application will link to user's slack accounts, where games can be arranged, players can be ranked and tournaments can be generated.

## Demo
(To be added)

## Quickstart
#### How to install the code:
1. Clone this project ```git clone https://github.com/paddlr/paddlr.git```
2. Change into the directory ```cd paddlr```
3. We have our project split into frontend and backend folders which are self contained so to quickly install all dependencies run `npm run install:all`
4. To run tests you need to cd into the relevant folder and run `npm run test`

## Project MockUp

## Development Process
#### MVP
* Build a single page app in React where user's can have their points counted for a single game of table-tennis.
* Points for each plater are counted by clicking a score button underneath the player's profile picture until a winner has been determined.
* Have an API that's fully-documented and validated that has game and user roots

(To be added)

### Testing and Code Quality Backend
- Eslint. Run `npm lint` to run through the model and view components.  
- Istanbul. To test coverage.
- Mocha is our test runner
- Chai is our BDD/TDD assertion library
- Run `npm test` within the backend folder

## Objectives
In a meeting before we had settled on the details we discussed what we wanted to get out of the project:

* Build a web app that could leave a legacy at Maker's
* Consolidate our learning from the previous 10 weeks
* Follow a TDD approach
* Write clean, readable code and ensure knowledge sharing
* Agile ceremonies: 9.30am stand-ups, check-ins and retros
* Pair programming and 2 day sprints
* XP values, especially communication, simplicity and respect
