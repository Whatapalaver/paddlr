## Objectives
In a meeting before we had settled on the details we discussed what we wanted to get out of the project:
* Build a web app that could leave a legacy at Maker's
* Consolidate our learning from the previous 10 weeks
* Follow a TDD approach
* Write clean, readable code and ensure knowledge sharing
* Agile ceremonies: 9.30am stand-ups, check-ins and retros
* Pair programming and 2 day sprints
* XP values, especially communication, simplicity and respect

## Project Diary:

### Week One

#### Day 1
Our group had been drawn together based on our mutual interest of developing an application based on games. Having been keen table tennis players during our time at Maker's and occassionaly having disputes about who's serve is who's or what the score was we decided to build an application which could enhance our experience positively. We could see a lot of room for added complexity beyond the fairly basic MVP, so were keen to create a full stack web app. Once we had decided on our MVP, we split up to do the inital administration such as the README, Trello etc., build the wireframe for the MVP using Adobe XD and research which database would be best to use with react.
